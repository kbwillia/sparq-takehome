# SPARQ AI Engineering Assignment - Kyle Wilson

## Overview

This repository contains my response to the SPARQ AI Engineering assignment for designing an AI-powered knowledge assistant for an educational nonprofit.

## Documents

### 📊 [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
**System Architecture Diagram & Technical Design**

Contains a detailed Mermaid diagram illustrating the complete system architecture, including:
- User interfaces and authentication layer
- AI orchestration and safety components
- Data processing pipelines
- Knowledge retrieval systems
- Monitoring and governance infrastructure

### 📝 [ASSIGNMENT_RESPONSE.md](ASSIGNMENT_RESPONSE.md)
**Complete Assignment Responses**

Comprehensive answers to all assignment questions:

1. **System Architecture** - High-level solution design with detailed component descriptions
2. **Prompt Engineering** - Example prompts for counselors and students with refinement strategies
3. **Client Discovery Questions** - 12 strategic questions covering data, privacy, operations, and vision
4. **Success Criteria & Evaluation** - KPIs, evaluation strategies, and feedback loops
5. **Bonus: Model Adaptation Strategy** - Fine-tuning approach, tooling, and cost-benefit analysis

## Key Design Principles

- **Safety First**: FERPA compliance, PII protection, and comprehensive access controls
- **RAG-Based Approach**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for maintainable, grounded responses
- **Role-Based Access**: Different capabilities for students, teachers, and counselors
- **Continuous Improvement**: Multi-layered feedback loops and monitoring
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices design that grows with the organization

## Technologies Discussed

- **LLMs**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Azure OpenAI
- **Vector Databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant
- **Orchestration**: LangChain, OpenAI Functions
- **Monitoring**: Weights & Biases, MLflow, custom audit logging
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-native microservices with horizontal scaling

## Quick Start

1. Review the [Architecture Diagram](ARCHITECTURE.md) for visual overview
2. Read the [Complete Response](ASSIGNMENT_RESPONSE.md) for detailed answers
3. Both documents are designed to be read independently or together
